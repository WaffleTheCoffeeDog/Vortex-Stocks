## Technical Things: 


- Market Trading = Automatically buying for lowest avalible, selling for highest limit. 

- Limit Trading = You set the price yourself. If the price you sell at is higher than the market price, you can only sell that stock once a limit buyer buys for the 
increased price, or the avaliblitly of all lower stocks runs out, in which case your stock becomes the new lowest on the market, becoming the market standard.

- NOTE | If limit trading is not used, the market price for that stock will not change. Market trading as it's designed in the real world, only buys and sells for 
market price. Limit trading is required for stock prices to change.
